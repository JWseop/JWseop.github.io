          제가 처음으로 팀장의 역할을 맡아 참여하게된 프로젝트 입니다. 프로젝트를 시작할 때 진행 일정 및 방식을 공유하여, 업무 순서에 맞춰 수월히 팀원들과 협력 할 수 있었습니다. 협업을 하며 가장 중요한 소통과 계획에 대한 중요성을 가장 많이 느낀 프로젝트 입니다.

3달 간 진행한 해당 프로젝트에서 마지막 2주 전, 한 팀원이 갑자기 탈퇴하였습니다. 긴급 회의를 통해 업무를 재분배하고 소통을 강화하여 프로젝트를 성공적으로 마무리하였습니다.
이를 통해 예기치 못한 상황에서도 팀원들과 함께 유연한 대처를 해보는 경험을 얻고, 팀원 간의 업무진척도를 공유하는 것의 중요성을 배웠습니다.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
